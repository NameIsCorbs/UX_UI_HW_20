        <h1> Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The Punk Rock Saves Lives site was designed to generate donations to fund the organization, to attract volunteers, and to support punk rock communities nationwide. We have observed that although people are engaging with their online store on the website and socials, the navigation and cluttered graphic content is inadvertently drawing traffic away from the volunteer and donation sections of the website. 
            How might we ensure users can reach the volunteer and donation Calls To Action?

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
            Punk Rock Saves Lives contributes to many worthwhile causes and helping their community. Their website, however, is an unintended hurdle to prospective volunteers and donors due to its poor design and layout.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>
            Redesigning the website with a more modern and organized design pattern, with an emphasis on driving traffic towards more clearly presented volunteer and donation opportunities will benefit the organization.

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>
            We began by conducting initial research and talking to the executive director of punk rock saves lives, Tina. 
            She mentioned how gaining reliable volunteers is one of her frustrations. 
            We explored the user side by conducting tests on their current site. 
            Many found volunteering on the website frustrating because it redirects to a completely different website and asks for registration without showing events. 
            Users were confused how to navigate back to the main site and why they needed to register.

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>
            Meet our user Luke Reynolds. He loves listening to punk rock, gets extremely frustrated with class struggles in America and would like to volunteer in his community with like-minded individuals to contribute to a better society where basic needs are provided for everyone.

            <p>
                We then took a look to see other related non-profit causes that could be defined as a "competitor".

                <h3>User Flow </h3>
                <p>
                    The goal of the flow was to present the user with as straightforward a method to find events to volunteer for. Our initial idea was to rely on a filterable calendar to find events that could then be signed up for and saved to a profile.

        <h1>Achievements & Final Insights</h1>
        <p>
            Our team chose Punk Rock Saves Lives because we’re all music lovers. PRSL’s mission unites punk music lovers with volunteer opportunities to do good in their communities; the goal of our case study was to facilitate that mission through engaging and intuitive design, and we feel we’ve accomplished that. Users are now presented with a modern homepage that removes obstacles to getting into a simple event selection and sign up flow for volunteering. 
We intend on presenting to PRSL and moving forward with a complete overhaul of the site’s other pages using our established heuristic and design patterns. We also discussed implementing a recurring volunteer newsletter opt in, to further increase return volunteers and preventing the account creation blocker.
